			<h1>dirtcheapcss 👨🏼‍💻</h1>
			<p>
				I needed something to quickly stylize a simple HTML page
				into a readable document that looked mostly good on all
				devices. This is what dirtcheapcss looks like.
			</p>

			<code>
				&lt;style&gt;
				html {
					color: #333;
					font: 300 1.2em -apple-system, sans-serif;
					max-width: 70ch;
					padding: 2ch;
					margin: auto;
				}
				&lt;/style&gt;
			</code>

			<p>
				This is clearly not meant for every solution, but in a pinch
				it can turn an ugly blog or documentation into a decent
				thing to look at.
			</p>

			<h2>Requirements ✅</h2>

			<p>
				There are only a few key requirements for this style that I
				wanted, though I might continue to tweak and extend further
				down the road.
			</p>

			<h3>Font 🖌</h3>
			<p>
				This might be more of a personal preference, but I really
				wanted to leverage the <a href="">San Francisco</a> font
				native to Apple devices. I'm sure there's something else
				nice I can add for Windows/Linux as well, but I'll do that
				whenever I go back to those platforms.
			</p>

			<h3>Headers 📰</h3>
			<p>
				Font size and margins need to clearly separate content
				into digestable blocks. I added a margin-top to each of the
				headers except <code>h1</code> since that will always be
				the main site header. The extra spacing helps keep the core
				content associated with its parent header.
			</p>

			<h3>Lists 📝</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Unordered and ordered lists need to look nice</li>
				<li>That's pretty easy actually</li>
				<li>No fiddling with anything really</li>
			</ol>
